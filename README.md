# Hello, I'm Saurabh Patil ðŸ‘‹

I'm Saurabh Sanjay Patil, hailing from Gadhinglaj. I hold a strong academic background, having completed my HSC and SSC from Gadhinglaj.  My passion lies in the realm of technology, particularly in web development, competitive coding, and AI/ML. In the sphere of web development, I gained hands-on experience during my internship at Progneur Technologies, where I worked with technologies like MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Material UI, Git, and GitHub. I've also crafted a diverse range of projects, including games, drawing apps, chat applications, portfolio websites, and open
API integrations, showcasing my versatility in developing web applications. In competitive coding, I've tackled over 250 unique problems across platforms such as GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, CodeChef, and HackerRank. I've even competed globally, achieving a remarkable 121st rank out of 27,000 participants in a coding contest.I possess a strong command of programming languages, including Python, C, Java, JavaScript, and C. My interests extend to machine learning and deep learning, where I've executed projects like house price prediction and Iris flower classification. I've honed my skills further through Andrew Ng's deep learning course. Additionally, I possess a foundational understanding of IoT and AR/VR technologies.
